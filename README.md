# Traffic-Light-PLC

## Description
This project involves the use of CodeSYS to simulate the real-time working of a traffic managememnt system.

The logic is implemented through a structed text PLC Program. The visualisation toolbox is then used to provide a visual representation of the logic.

The traffic lights on the 4 crossroad are indicated using 3 Lamps found in the visualisation toolbox.
along with this the the pedestrian crossing is also indicated at each of the 4 crossroads using 2 other Lamps.
